# FleetManager

The provided task is done with Node.js and Postgresql. 

My solution has two tables; Models and Vehicles. 

Models represents entities which contains general information about the vehicle. A single car dealership could have dozens of vehicles of the same model (or a factory could have thousands of them), and it would be inefficient to have same information on several tables if it stays the same.

Vehicles contains information that makes vehicles unique. Currently it has registration number, inspection date and a foreign key referring which to the car it represents. This table is joined with Models in the backend.

# Installation
Following instructions are primarily meant for Linux.

Step 1: Install postgres to your system. Instructions can be found here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Step 2:
Our configuration uses default user 'postgres' with password 'password.
Search for pg_hba.conf file. On Linux it should be located in /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf. Open it and locate the following line:
local all postgres md5

Make sure that it's 'md5', and not something else. This will allow us to use server connection locally.
Restart the server: sudo service postgresql restart.

Open the database editor with the following command:
sudo -u postgres psql

Add a password for the default user 'postgres' with the following query:
ALTER USER postgres WITH password 'password';

Now we've configured our database. If you want to create your own configuration make sure that you update /utils/config.js.

Step 3: Launch the server with start_server.sh on the first time, it will delete any existing tables, recreate them and insert the test data. The server will start at http://localhost:3001/. You can launch with npm run watch without removing the data.
