# FleetManager

The provided task is done with Node.js and Postgresql. 

My solution has two tables; Models and Vehicles. The original solution that I had developed (can be found on older commits) had a single table, and that could be a better solution if the cars are mostly unique. However we're going to make an assumption that this is a big fleet with lots of cars of the same model; it's also why I picked Postgres.

Models represents entities which contains general information about the vehicle. A single car dealership could have dozens of vehicles of the same model (or a factory with thousands of them), and it would be inefficient to have same information on several tables if it stays the same. 

Id, brand, model, model_year and engine_power mustn't be null, engine_displacement isn't null because it could be an electric car for example.

Vehicles contains information that makes vehicles unique. Currently it has registration number, inspection date and a foreign key referring which to the car it represents. This table is joined with Models in the backend.

Id, registration_number and model_id mustn't be null, inspection_date can be null if the car hasn't had an inspection yet. Registration_number isn't required to be unique because changing plate from one car to another could become a hassle database-wise.

# Installation
Following instructions are primarily meant for Linux.

Step 1: 

Clone the project, run npm install. Install postgres to your system. Instructions can be found here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Step 2: 

Configuring postgres can be a hassle, but I hope these instructions are found useful. Our configuration uses default user 'postgres' with password 'password'.

Search for pg_hba.conf file. On Linux it should be located in /etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf. Open it and locate the following line:

local all postgres md5

If the line doesn't exist add it at the end of the file. Make also sure that it's 'md5', and not something else. This will allow us to use server connection locally.

Restart the server: sudo service postgresql restart.

Step 3:

Open the database editor with the following command:
sudo -u postgres psql

Add a password for the default user 'postgres' with the following query:
ALTER USER postgres WITH password 'password';

Now we've configured our database. If you want to create your own configuration make sure that you update /utils/config.js.

Step 4: Launch the server with start_server.sh on the first time, it will delete any existing tables, recreate them and insert the test data. The server will start at http://localhost:3001/. You can launch with npm run watch without removing the data.

# Models-table
**GET: /api/models/**

This will fetch all individual models in the fleet.

**GET: /api/models/:id**

This will fetch a single model in the fleet where the id is a parameter

**POST: /api/models/**

Post will create a new model to the fleet. This can be joined with vehicles-table to create a new vehicle.

Insert following data as raw JSON on Postman:

{
    "brand": "BMW",
    "model": "316i",
    "model_year": 2014,
    "engine_displacement": 2600,
    "engine_power": 150
}

![model-post](images/model-post.png)

**PUT: /api/models/:id**

Updates a single model in the fleet where the id is a parameter

Insert following data as raw JSON on Postman
{
    "brand": "BMW",
    "model": "316i",
    "model_year": 2019,
    "engine_displacement": 2900,
    "engine_power": 176
}


![model-put](images/model-put.png)

**DELETE: /api/models/:id**

Deletes a single model from the fleet where the id is a parameter


![model-delete](images/model-delete.png)

**GET: /api/models/brand/:brand**

Fetches all models where the name of the brand is brand-parameter.

**GET: /api/models/model/:model**

Fetches all models where the name of the model is model-parameter.

**GET: /api/models/year/:min/:max**

Fetches all models created between min-and max-parameters. 

# Vehicles-table
/api/vehicles

**GET: /api/vehicles/**

This will fetch all vehicles in the fleet. The vehicle-table is joined with a model!

**GET: /api/vehicles/:id**

This will fetch a single vehicle in the fleet where the id is a parameter

**POST: /api/vehicles**

Post will create a new vehicle to the fleet. This must be joined with a model.

Insert following data as raw JSON on postman:

{
	"registration_number": "UUS-144",
	"inspection_date": "2017-01-22",
	"model_id": 1003
}

**PUT: /api/vehicles/:id**

Updates a single model in the fleet where the id is a parameter
Insert following data as raw JSON on postman

{
	"registration_number": "ABC-123",
	"inspection_date": "2019-01-15",
	"model_id": 1000
}

**DELETE: /api/vehicles/:id**

Deletes a single model from the fleet where the id is a parameter

**GET: /api/vehicles/brand/:brand**

Fetches all vehicles where the name of the brand is brand-parameter.

**GET: /api/vehicles/model/:model**

Fetches all vehicles where the name of the model is model-parameter.

**GET: /api/vehicles/year/:min/:max**

Fetches all vehicles created between min-and max-parameters.
